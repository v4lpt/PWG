# Title
This is a password generator that (hopefully) generates human-readable, pronounceable, and memorable passwords while also adhering to most password-making rules (1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 special character, numbers). 

<b><font color="#efcac2">The generated password is automatically copied to the clipboard.</font></b>

It is created locally, and nothing is saved.
